# Foundation For Public Code Jekyll Theme

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/publiccodenet/jekyll-theme.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/publiccodenet/jekyll-theme)

A jekyll theme for the set up of quick generic static sites and for use with GitHub pages.

## Building locally

This theme is built to run predictably on GitHub pages, therefore the [`github-pages`](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) gem is required. Run `bundle install` before building with Jekyll.

To serve locally with Jekyll, use `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

## Customising

### Table of contents

#### For your whole site

You can turn on the display of Table of Contents ('On this page' section) for any page by adding `toc: true` to the `_config.yml` 

#### For just a specific page

Or adding `toc: true` to the front matter of any page where you want the Table of Contents to display.
